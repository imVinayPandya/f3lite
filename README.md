### ðŸ“œ F3 Lite
All the debug info you need, none of the clutter.

**F3 Lite** is a lightweight HUD overlay that gives you the most important debug info â€” without cluttering your screen with the full F3 menu. (Inspired by dream speed running HUD overlay)

Toggle overlay with a single key (default: F7)
